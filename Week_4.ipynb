    "Many IT companies landed their headquaters in the pacific northwest.  To name a few: Amazon, Tableau, Redfin from Seattle; Microsoft from Redmond and Expedia from Bellevue.  This not only caused a growth in population but also great increase in housing price in those cities.  Because houses are becoming unaffordable to a lot of people working in those big cities, the outer cities have became popular for new comers to move into.  This notebook will explore Bellevue and one of the nearbt cities and observe the differences."
